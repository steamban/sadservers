Scenario: "Saskatoon": counting IPs.

Level: Easy

Type: Do

Tags: bash  

Access: Email

Description: There's a web server access log file at /home/admin/access.log. The file consists of one line per HTTP request, with the requester's IP address at the beginning of each line (first column).

Find what's the IP address that has the most requests in this file (there's no tie; the IP is unique). Write the solution into a file /home/admin/highestip.txt. For example, if your solution is "1.2.3.4", you can do echo "1.2.3.4" > /home/admin/highestip.txt

NOTE: The solution IP shows 482 times, ie grep -c -F -f highestip.txt access.log returns 482, if your solution has a different (lower) number you got the wrong most common IP.

Root (sudo) Access: True

Test: The SHA1 checksum of the IP address sha1sum /home/admin/highestip.txt is 6ef426c40652babc0d081d438b9f353709008e93 (just a way to verify the solution without giving it away, we also accept the right IP with no ending newline in the file.)

The "Check My Solution" button runs the script /home/admin/agent/check.sh, which you can see and execute.

Time to Solve: 15 minutes.
